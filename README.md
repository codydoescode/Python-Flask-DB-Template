# Creating database driven websites using Python Flask
## Purpose

This project aims to make it easy for anyone to get started creating database driven websites. This repository includes an example Dockerfile & GitHub Action workflow to allow you easily build & deploy your solution whilst maintaining best practices for security.


## Requirements
```
flask
python-dotenv
sqlalchemy
pyodbc
```

The database portion of this project assumes Microsoft SQL Server on Linux.

## Early days?

This sucks as a tutorial, doesn't it? The goal is to flesh this out with proper documentation and a Wiki page you can consult whilst remaining easy to clone, edit & deploy! I'm sure this idea isn't original at all also! Brilliant!

## GitHub Actions
The one and only action i've built for this project is failing because the repo name isn't all lowercase. I'll think about this while I stare at the ceiling.
